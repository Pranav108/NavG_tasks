        Websites often include forms as a part of their customer data collection
        strategy. A well-made survey form can help you acquire relevant
        information about your target audiences like their demographic age, job,
        location, taste and preference, and pain points. This HTML project is a
        great way to test your skills and knowledge of designing forms and
        structuring a webpage.
        <br /><br />
        Building a survey form is no rocket science. You need to acquaint
        yourself with the basic tags/input fields in HTML required to design
        forms. Then you can use the tags to create a text field, checkbox, radio
        button, date, and other vital elements contained in a form. Again, you
        can always use CSS to impart a better look and feel to your form and
        webpage.
